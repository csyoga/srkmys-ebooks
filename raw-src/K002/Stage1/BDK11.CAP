@ENGLISHFTNOTE = <F14P10>* When to Article 28 which prohibits `religious 
instruction' in educational institutions maintained out of State Funds, 
I moved an amendment that the ban should not apply to `Moral and Spiritual 
Instruction', it was rejected, and I felt sad; it augured ill for 
the future... India's political awakening was preceded by a luminous 
religio-spiritual renasissance which indeed provided the foundation 
and infrastructure for our freedom struggle. So, if our parliamentary 
democratic polity had continued to be vivified by Moral and Spiritual 
Values, all would have been well with us.<197>H. V. Kamath, Bhavan's 
Journal, August 1981.<F255P255>



@ENGLISHFTNOTE = * Science deals with but a partial aspect of reality. 
There is no faintest reason for supporting that everything Science 
ignores is less real than what it accepts. We are no longer taught 
that the Scientific Method of approaching is the only valid method 
of acquiring knowledge about reality. Eminent men of Science are insisting, 
with what seems a strange enthusiasm, on the fact that Science gives 
us but a partial knowledge of reality, and we are no longer required 
to regard as illusory, everything that Science finds itself able to 
ignore.<197>W. N. Sullivan

@NOLNABVENGFTN = <F14P10>* The Indian religions are not exclusively-minded. 
They are ready to allow that there may be alternative approaches to 
the mystery. I feel sure that in this they are right, and that this 
catholic-minded Indian religious spirit is the way of salvation for 
human beings of all religions in an age in which we have to learn 
to live as a single family if we are not to destroy ourselves.<197>Arnold 
Toynbee

@ENGLISHFTNOTE = <F14P10>* It is in the light of our beliefs about the 
ultimate nature of reality that we formulate our conceptions of right 
and wrong; and it is in the light of our conceptions of right and 
wrong that we frame our conduct, not only in the relations of private 
life, but also in the sphere of politics and economics. So, far from 
being irrelevant, our metaphysical beliefs are the finally determining 
factor in all our actions.<197>Aldous Huxley<F255P255>
