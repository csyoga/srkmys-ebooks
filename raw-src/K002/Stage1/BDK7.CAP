@ENGLISHFTNOTE = <F173P11M>1.<F255P255D> Far from its august perspective the 
universe is revealed as one elemental field in which each star, each 
atom, each wandering comet and slow-wheeling galaxy and flying electron 
is seen to be but a ripple or tumescence in the underlying space-time 
unity.

@NOLNABVENGFTN = <F173P11M>2.<F255P255D> Thus, all man's perceptions of the

@NOLNABVENGFTN = <F173P11M>4<F255P255D>. Since motion and change are essential 
properties of things, the forces causing the motion are not outside 
the objects, but are an intrinsic property of matter. Correspondingly, 
the Eastern image of the Divine is not that of a ruler who directs 
the world from above, but of a principle that controls everything 
from within.<197>Dr. Capra

@ENGLISHFTNOTE = <F173P11M>1.<F255P255D> It is only a narrow view of what 
is natural that prevents our recognising the presence of God every 
where within and around us. Nothing is real except God, and relations 
of time and space are only the order of His manifestation. Nature 
is just the manifestation of God and evolution is no more biological 
or physical phenomenon, but the order in time relations of His Manifestations.<197>J. 
S. Haldane, The Science and Philosophy.

@ENGLISHFTNOTE = <F173P11M>1<F255P255D>.  My religion consists of a humble 
admiration of the illimitable Superior Spirit who reveals Himself 
in the slight details we are able to preceive with our frail and feeble 
minds. That deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a Superior 
Reasoning Power, which is revealed in he incomprehensible universe 
forms my idea of God.<197>Einstein
