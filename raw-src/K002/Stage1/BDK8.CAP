@ENGLISHFTNOTE = * If a child sees no hope of success in his work, 
his eagerness for knowledge will be stifled, and cold bitterness will 
grip a child's heart which no effort whatsoever will be able to thaw 
out until the spark of eagerness lights up again (and kindling it 
a second time is an infinitely difficult task); a child loses faith 
in his capacity, shuts up like a clam, becomes wary and prickly, responds 
with brazen resentment to advice and emonstrations from his teachers. 
Or worse still<197>his sense of dignity is undermined and he reconciles 
himself to the thought that he has no real ability. My heart is always 
filled with anger and indignation, when I see one of these apathetic, 
resigned children who is ready to listen patiently to a teacher's 
exhortations for hours at a stretch and completely indifferent to 
the words of his classmates; when they reproach him with lagging behind 
or repeating a class. . . There is nothing more immoral than kill 
another person's sense of dignity !
