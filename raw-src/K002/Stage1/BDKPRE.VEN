@ENGFOOTNOTEPA = * Religion is not a matter of personal sentiment 
that has nothing to do with the objective realities of society but 
is, on the contrary, the heart of social life and the root of every 
living culture. We are just beginning to understand how intimately 
and profoundly the vitality of any society is bound up in its religion. 
It is the religious impulse which supplies the cohesive force which 
unifies the society and the culture. The great civilizations of the 
world do not produce the great religions as a kind of cultural byproduct; 
in a very real sense, the religions are the foundations on which the 
great civili- zations rest. A society which has lost its religion 
becomes sooner or later a society which has lost its culture.<197>Christopher

a man for discovering the truth; you can call him a fool and try to 
laugh him out of the court ; but that does not alter the truth.' `It 
lies not in your power' said Andrew Melville, `to hang or exile the 
truth. Truth may be attacked, delayed, suppressed, mocked at, but 
time brings in its revenges and in the end truth prevails. A man must 
have a care that he is not fighting against the truth.'<197><MI>The
