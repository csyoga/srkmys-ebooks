    <span class="en">* Civilized societies which have most strictly limited  sexual freedom have developed the highest culutres. In the whole of  human history not a single case is found in which a society advanced  to the Rationalistic Culture without its women being born and reared  in a rigidly enforced pattern of faithfulness to one man. Further,  there is no example of a community which has retained its high position  on the culture scale after less rigorous sexual customs have replaced  more restricting ones.–Pitirim A. Sorokin, Sane Sex Order,  Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bombay.  </span>
