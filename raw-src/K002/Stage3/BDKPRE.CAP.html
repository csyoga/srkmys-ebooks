    <span class="en">* Religion is not a matter of personal sentiment  that has nothing to do with the objective realities of society but  is, on the contrary, the heart of social life and the root of every  living culture. We are just beginning to understand how intimately  and profoundly the vitality of any society is bound up in its religion.  It is the religious impulse which supplies the cohesive force which  unifies the society and the culture. The great civilizations of the  world do not produce the great religions as a kind of cultural byproduct;  in a very real sense, the religions are the foundations on which the  great civili- zations rest. A society which has lost its religion  becomes sooner or later a society which has lost its culture.–Christopher  Dowson : <span class="en">Inquiries into Religion and Culture, Sheed & Ward  </span></span>

      <span class="en">‘You can threaten to torture  a man for discovering the truth; you can call him a fool and try to  laugh him out of the court ; but that does not alter the truth.’ ‘It  lies not in your power’ said Andrew Melville, ‘to hang or exile the  truth. Truth may be attacked, delayed, suppressed, mocked at, but  time brings in its revenges and in the end truth prevails. A man must  have a care that he is not fighting against the truth.’–The  Daily Study Bible : The Gospel of Mark by William Barclay, Page  102; Published by Theological Publications in Inida, Malleswarm West,  Bangalore.  </span>
