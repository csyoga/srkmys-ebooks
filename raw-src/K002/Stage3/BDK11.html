      <span class="en">* When to Article 28 which prohibits ‘religious  instruction’ in educational institutions maintained out of State Funds,  I moved an amendment that the ban should not apply to ‘Moral and Spiritual  Instruction’, it was rejected, and I felt sad; it augured ill for  the future... India’s political awakening was preceded by a luminous  religio-spiritual renasissance which indeed provided the foundation  and infrastructure for our freedom struggle. So, if our parliamentary  democratic polity had continued to be vivified by Moral and Spiritual  Values, all would have been well with us.–H. V. Kamath, Bhavan’s  Journal, August 1981.</span>

    <span class="en">* Science deals with but a partial aspect of reality.  There is no faintest reason for supporting that everything Science  ignores is less real than what it accepts. We are no longer taught  that the Scientific Method of approaching is the only valid method  of acquiring knowledge about reality. Eminent men of Science are insisting,  with what seems a strange enthusiasm, on the fact that Science gives  us but a partial knowledge of reality, and we are no longer required  to regard as illusory, everything that Science finds itself able to  ignore.–W. N. Sullivan  </span>

      <span class="en">* The Indian religions are not exclusively-minded.  They are ready to allow that there may be alternative approaches to  the mystery. I feel sure that in this they are right, and that this  catholic-minded Indian religious spirit is the way of salvation for  human beings of all religions in an age in which we have to learn  to live as a single family if we are not to destroy ourselves.–Arnold  Toynbee  </span>

      <span class="en">* It is in the light of our beliefs about the  ultimate nature of reality that we formulate our conceptions of right  and wrong; and it is in the light of our conceptions of right and  wrong that we frame our conduct, not only in the relations of private  life, but also in the sphere of politics and economics. So, far from  being irrelevant, our metaphysical beliefs are the finally determining  factor in all our actions.–Aldous Huxley</span>
