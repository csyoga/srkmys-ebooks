<p>properties of things, the forces causing the motion are not outside </p>
<p>the objects, but are an intrinsic property of matter. Correspondingly, </p>
<p>the Eastern image of the Divine is not that of a ruler who directs </p>
<p>the world from above, but of a principle that controls everything </p>
<p>from within.åDr. Capra</p>

<div><span class="en">1.</span> It is only a narrow view of what </div>
<p>is natural that prevents our recognising the presence of God every </p>
<p>where within and around us. Nothing is real except God, and relations </p>
<p>of time and space are only the order of His manifestation. Nature </p>
<p>is just the manifestation of God and evolution is no more biological </p>
<p>or physical phenomenon, but the order in time relations of His Manifestations.åJ. </p>
