<div>* If a child sees no hope of success in his work, </div>
<p>his eagerness for knowledge will be stifled, and cold bitterness will </p>
<p>grip a child's heart which no effort whatsoever will be able to thaw </p>
<p>out until the spark of eagerness lights up again (and kindling it </p>
<p>a second time is an infinitely difficult task); a child loses faith </p>
<p>in his capacity, shuts up like a clam, becomes wary and prickly, responds </p>
<p>with brazen resentment to advice and emonstrations from his teachers. </p>
<p>Or worse stillåhis sense of dignity is undermined and he reconciles </p>
<p>himself to the thought that he has no real ability. My heart is always </p>
<p>filled with anger and indignation, when I see one of these apathetic, </p>
<p>resigned children who is ready to listen patiently to a teacher's </p>
<p>exhortations for hours at a stretch and completely indifferent to </p>
<p>the words of his classmates; when they reproach him with lagging behind </p>
<p>or repeating a class. . . There is nothing more immoral than kill </p>
<p>another person's sense of dignity !</p>

<div>Interest in learning is only to be found where there </div>
<p>is inspiration born of success.åV. Sukhomlinsky, On Education</p>
