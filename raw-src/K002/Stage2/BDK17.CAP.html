<div><span class="en"><span class="en">* Prayer is the most powerful form of energy  one can generate. It is a force as real as terrestrial gravity. As  a physician, I have seen men, after all other therapy had failed,  lifted out of disease and melancholy by the serene effort of prayer  . . . Prayer, like radium, is a source of luminous, self-generating  energy . . . . When we pray we link ourselves with the inexhaustible  motive force which spins the universe. Even in asking, our human deficiencies  are filled and we arise strengthened and repaired . . . whenever we  address God in fervent prayer, we change both soul and body for the  better.–Dr. Alexis Carrel  </span></span></div>
