<div><span class="en">* Man is capable of a little and a lot, of everything  and a nothing.–Pascal.  </span></div>





<div><span class="en"><span class="en">1</span>. No books, no scriputres, no science  can ever imagine the glory of the self that appears as man, the most  glorious God that ever was, the only God that ever existed.åSwami  Vivekananda  </span></div>

<div><span class="en"><span class="en">2</span>. Man stands between two infinitie;  the infinitely small and the infinitely big.åBertrand Rusell  </span></div>

<div><span class="en"><span class="en">3</span>. What is man in the Universe ? A nothing  compared to the infinite, a something compared to the nothingåa  middle between nothing and every- thingåPascal  </span></div>



<div><span class="en"><span class="en">1.</span> Far from its august perspective the  universe is revealed as one elemental field in which each star, each  atom, each wandering comet and slow-wheeling galaxy and flying electron  is seen to be but a ripple or tumescence in the underlying space-time  unity.  </span></div>

<div><span class="en"><span class="en">2.</span> Thus, all man's perceptions of the  world and all his abstract intuitions of reality merge finally into  one, and the deep underlying unity of the universe is laid bare.åLincoln  Barnett  </span></div>

<div><span class="en"><span class="en">3.</span> Infinite stars and minute atoms not  only converge but also exist as integral unitsåV. Rednick  </span></div>

<div><span class="en"><span class="en">4</span>. Since motion and change are essential  properties of things, the forces causing the motion are not outside  the objects, but are an intrinsic property of matter. Correspondingly,  the Eastern image of the Divine is not that of a ruler who directs  the world from above, but of a principle that controls everything  from within.åDr. Capra  </span></div>



<div><span class="en"><span class="en">1.</span> Quantum theory forces us to see the  universe not as a collection of physical objects, but rather as a  complicated web of relation between the various parts of unified whole.åDr.  Capra  </span></div>

<div><span class="en"><span class="en">1.</span> It is only a narrow view of what  is natural that prevents our recognising the presence of God every  where within and around us. Nothing is real except God, and relations  of time and space are only the order of His manifestation. Nature  is just the manifestation of God and evolution is no more biological  or physical phenomenon, but the order in time relations of His Manifestations.åJ.  S. Haldane, The Science and Philosophy.  </span></div>

<div><span class="en"><span class="en">2.</span> . . . .this evolutionary drive is  `directed' as if by some single gigantic organism.åChardin Phenomenon  of Man  </span></div>

<div><span class="en"><span class="en">1</span>.  My religion consists of a humble  admiration of the illimitable Superior Spirit who reveals Himself  in the slight details we are able to preceive with our frail and feeble  minds. That deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a Superior  Reasoning Power, which is revealed in he incomprehensible universe  forms my idea of God.åEinstein  </span></div>
