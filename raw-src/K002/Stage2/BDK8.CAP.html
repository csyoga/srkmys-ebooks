<div><span class="en">* If a child sees no hope of success in his work,  his eagerness for knowledge will be stifled, and cold bitterness will  grip a child's heart which no effort whatsoever will be able to thaw  out until the spark of eagerness lights up again (and kindling it  a second time is an infinitely difficult task); a child loses faith  in his capacity, shuts up like a clam, becomes wary and prickly, responds  with brazen resentment to advice and emonstrations from his teachers.  Or worse still–his sense of dignity is undermined and he reconciles  himself to the thought that he has no real ability. My heart is always  filled with anger and indignation, when I see one of these apathetic,  resigned children who is ready to listen patiently to a teacher's  exhortations for hours at a stretch and completely indifferent to  the words of his classmates; when they reproach him with lagging behind  or repeating a class. . . There is nothing more immoral than kill  another person's sense of dignity !  </span></div>
