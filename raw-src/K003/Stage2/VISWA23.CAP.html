<h1><span class="en">AN INDIAN MONK IN LONDON  </span></h1>

<div><span class="en"><span class="en">An interesting figure has lately arrived in  this country in the person of Swami Vivekananda, an Indian Yogi-one  who formally renounces the world, and gives himself to study and devotion.  He left India to express his interpretation of the Vedanta philosophy  to Western people at the Parliament of Religions held at Chicago in  1893.  </span></span></div>

<div><span class="en">Since that event he has been teaching and lecturing  in America. He has now reached England, but will after a short visit  return to America, to carry on his self-appointed task there during  the winter.  </span></div>

<div><span class="en"><span class="en">He will lecture at Princeâ€™s Hall, Piccadilly,  tomorrow evening.  </span></span></div>
