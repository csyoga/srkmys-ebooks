@CHAPTERHEADNG = <F14P10M>AN INDIAN MONK IN LONDON

@ENGLISHBODYTX = <F14P10M>An interesting figure has lately arrived in 
this country in the person of Swami Vivekananda, an Indian Yogi-one 
who formally renounces the world, and gives himself to study and devotion. 
He left India to express his interpretation of the Vedanta philosophy 
to Western people at the Parliament of Religions held at Chicago in 
1893.

@NOINDENTENGTX = Since that event he has been teaching and lecturing 
in America. He has now reached England, but will after a short visit 
return to America, to carry on his self-appointed task there during 
the winter.

@ENGLISHBODYTX = <F14P10M>He will lecture at Prince's Hall, Piccadilly, 
tomorrow evening.
